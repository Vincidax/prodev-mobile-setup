# Mobile Development Setup

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Mobile development demands more computational resources compared to web development. To simplify the process and provide a smooth developer experience, we are using the **Expo Framework for React Native**. Expo Go allows us to test and run React Native applications directly on physical devices without relying on resource-heavy emulators.

This setup ensures we are ready for upcoming mobile development projects.
